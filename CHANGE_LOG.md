- **Type**: Feature (Visual Haptic Feedback)
- **Content**: Added visual spring animation (`transform: scale(0.97)` on `:active`) to `.folder-tile`, `.leaf-wrapper`, and `.bookmark-card` to provide pseudo-haptic physical feedback upon user clicks.
- **Type**: BugFix (Visual Haptic Feedback)
- **Content**: Fixed an issue where the `transform: scale(0.97)` on `:active` would pull inner child buttons (like the expand button, hide icon, and bookmark actions) out from under the cursor, causing `click` events to fail. Used `:not(:has(...:hover))` pseudo-class to prevent the scale animation when the user is interacting with these specific child buttons.
- **Type**: BugFix (CSS Encoding)
- **Content**: Fixed garbled characters (`â¤¢`) showing on the card expand button on hover by replacing the literal character `⤢` with its CSS unicode escape sequence `\2922`.
- **Type**: BugFix (Flat Mode Layout)
- **Content**: Increased horizontal gaps `gap: 16px 32px;` and right-padding in the flat-mode `.directory-pane` to create a safe corridor. This prevents the mouse from accidentally triggering a hover switch to the second-column folders when the user moves diagonally from the first column into the bookmarks list pane.
- **Type**: Optimization (Visual quality)
- **Content**: Implemented three advanced aesthetic refinements: 
  - 1. Added a subtle top gradient to the main container to improve date and search bar readability on bright backgrounds.
  - 2. Applied `drop-shadow` to bookmark icons to give them better depth and visual separation.
  - 3. Added a "Hover Focus" effect that slightly dims un-hovered items in the directory and bookmark panes, enhancing focus on the current target.
- **Type**: Optimization (Flat Mode Dark Mode Adaptation)
- **Content**: Adapted Flat Mode for better visibility in Dark Mode by reinforcing header separators with brand-themed gradients, increasing pane border opacity, and improving breadcrumb readability.
